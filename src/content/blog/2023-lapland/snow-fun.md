On our second day in Rovaniemi, we started with a short husky ride with [Pure Lapland](https://purelapland.fi/), which gave us a taste of what it's like to ride with a team of dogs. It was such a unique and thrilling experience, and we got to spend so much time snuggling with the adorable huskies. However we wanted more than a 6 km ride, so we decided to book a longer husky ride later in the week with Frozen Lake Husky.

## Afternoon Snow Fun
In the afternoon, we headed outside to play in the snow and make snow angels. We grabbed a sleigh from our Airbnb and headed to the garden of the Arktikum Museum, which is located on the riverbank. It was a great spot to enjoy the snow and have some fun on the sleigh.

## Mpemba Effect
One of the highlights of the day was trying the Mpemba effect in the cold weather. The Mpemba effect is a phenomenon where hot water freezes faster than cold water, and we were able to see it in action at -17 degrees Celsius! Really nice to be able to try it out.
