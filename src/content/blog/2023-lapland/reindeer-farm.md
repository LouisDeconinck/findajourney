On the third day of our trip to Rovaniemi, we had an incredible opportunity to visit an authentic reindeer farm with [Johka](https://www.johka.fi/), a local business in Rovaniemi owned by Tuomo. Johka, which means river in Lappish, flows through the haert of the magic wilderness.

## Scenic Journey to the Farm
Tuomo drove us from our airbnb to the farm, he is the only one who works with this farm, which made our experience incredibly peaceful and quiet. It was refreshing to escape the tourist crowds and immerse ourselves in the daily life of a reindeer farmer. To reach the farm, we enjoyed a scenic snowmobile ride that provided us with breathtaking views of the surrounding wilderness.

## Feeding the Reindeer
Upon arrival at the farm, we were greeted by over 100 majestic reindeer. We had the incredible opportunity to help feed the reindeer, which was an unforgettable experience. We threw straw in lines next to the reindeer and watched as they eagerly devoured it.

## Shedding Antlers
After we finished feeding the reindeer, we hopped on a reindeer sleigh ride. As we glided through the snowy landscape, we witnessed one of nature's most amazing phenomena - the reindeer shedding its antlers. We were fascinated to learn that reindeer shed their antlers every year and felt incredibly lucky to witness this incredible event.

After the sleigh ride, the farmer and his family offered us a delicious selection of traditional Lappish snacks, including some of the best reindeer meat we've ever tasted. We also had a chance to warm up with a cup of hot tea around the fire and chat with the farmer and his family. It was the perfect opportunity to ask questions and learn more about the fascinating culture and way of life in Lapland. After this wonderful experience Tuomo drove us back to our airbnb.

## Ounasvaara Winter Trail
In the afternoon, we decided to take a walk in Ounasvaarra on the Ounasvaarra winter trail. This magical winter wonderland trail provided us with stunning panoramic views of the surrounding snow-covered hills and forests. The trail was dotted with small cabins where we could warm up and take in the scenery.

Overall, our visit to the authentic reindeer farm with Johka was a highlight of our trip to Lapland. It was a truly unique and unforgettable experience that we will always cherish. If you're looking for an authentic and peaceful Lapland experience, we highly recommend visiting Johka and Tuomo's reindeer farm.
