We woke up on day 4 of our Lapland trip excited for a new adventure. We had heard about the possibility of renting cross-country skis at Santa Sport and decided to give it a try. At first, we were a bit hesitant because we had never done it before and didn't want to get lost or end up in a difficult situation. However, after considering the cost of a guided group activity and the potential for a more peaceful and quiet experience, we decided to rent the skis and head out on our own.

## Cross-Country Skiing in the Ounasvaarra Forest
We arrived at Santa Sport and rented the skis, then made our way to the beautiful Ounasvaarra forest. The snowy landscape was breathtaking and we felt so peaceful and calm as we glided through the snow. My partner had a bit of a rough start, falling face-first into the snow, but after that, we quickly picked up the technique and enjoyed the experience even more.

We spent a few hours skiing through the forest, enjoying the beautiful scenery and the peace and quiet. It was such an amazing experience that we are now considering making cross-country skiing a regular part of our winter activities.

## No Luck with the Northern Lights
After returning our skis, we went back to our Airbnb to rest, as cross-country skiing is quite an exhausting activity. That evening, we visited the Arkticum Museum, hoping to catch a glimpse of the northern lights. Unfortunately, we were greeted with cloudy skies, and didn't see the lights. However, we remained hopeful as we were picking up a rental car the next day, which would allow us to venture further away from the city lights and hopefully catch a better view of the aurora borealis.
