Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, is a charming and picturesque city that is known for its rich history, vibrant culture, and stunning architecture. Our first day in Ljubljana began with a leisurely stroll through the city center, taking in the sights and sounds of this charming city.

## Exploring the city center with the Ljubljana City Card

As we walked around, we decided to purchase the Ljubljana City Card, which offers access to various city attractions and transportation for 24 hours.

We activated our card around 11am and started our journey with a regular guided city tour. The tour gave us a great overview of the city's history and culture and allowed us to see some of the city's main sights, such as the Triple Bridge and the Ljubljana Cathedral.

Did you know the dragon is the symbol of Ljubjana? Legend has it that the dragon once lived near the city and was defeated by patron Saint Georeges.

## Climbing to the top of Ljubljana Castle for panoramic views

Next, we took the funicular to the Ljubljana Castle (included in the city card), which is perched atop a hill overlooking the city. The castle offers panoramic views of the city and the surrounding hills and is a must-visit attraction in Ljubljana.

The castle itself is a fascinating place to explore, with its history dating back to the 11th century. It also houses several museums and exhibitions, including the Virtual Castle, the Museum of Slovenian History and the museum of puppetry.

## Sailing down the Ljubljanica River for a unique perspective

After taking in the views from the castle, we took a boat ride on the Ljubljanica River (included in the city card), which runs through the city center. It was a unique and peaceful way to see the city from a different perspective. We even had a really nice lunch on the boat, which was a great experience since we were the only ones on that boat.

After the boat tour, we stopped at one of the many terraces for a refreshing drink and to take in the views of the city. The terrace was a great spot to relax and enjoy the warm summer evening.

## Enjoying a summer evening in the city with an a capella concert

Later on, we decided to go for an evening walk and by chance, we stumbled upon an a capella concert in Ljubljana with the backdrop of the castle all lit up with lights.

It was the perfect way to end our day and we couldn't have asked for a better way to experience the city's culture and atmosphere. The concert was a great blend of traditional and modern music and the singers were very talented.

The concert and the castle all lit up made for a magical experience, and the perfect end to our first day in Ljubljana. It was the perfect blend of culture, history and relaxation in this charming city. We couldn't wait to see what the next day would bring.

## Exploring the botanical beauty of the Arboretum

Our second day in Slovenia started early as we wanted to make the most of our Ljubljana City Card and visit the Arboretum and the Snovik Thermal Spa before 11 a.m. on the way to Lake Bled.

After picking up our rental car, we made our way to the Arboretum, where we spent over an hour walking around and admiring the beautiful nature. The Arboretum is a botanical garden with a collection of over 3,000 species of woody plants from different parts of the world. As we walked around, we noticed the different varieties of trees, shrubs, and flowers that were present in the garden.

The Arboretum also has a number of educational trails, that are perfect for families with children. The peaceful atmosphere of the place made it a perfect spot to relax and take in the beauty of nature.

Next, we headed to the Snovik Thermal Spa, which is a spa complex located in the heart of the Triglav National Park. The spa offers a variety of pools, water slides, saunas, and steam rooms, as well as relaxation areas.
