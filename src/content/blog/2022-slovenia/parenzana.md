## Exploring the Parenzana Trail: Riding from Portoroz to Koper
Today was dedicated to discovering the beauty of the country's Adriatic coast. After a good night of sleep at The Blue House - Guesthouse, we started by renting bikes from the Aerodrom of Portoroz, which is just a 15-minute walk from the Guesthouse where we stayed the night. Our goal for the day was to ride along the Parenzana route from Portoroz to Koper to discover the beautiful coastline.

The Parenzana was a narrow-gauge railway that operated in the early 20th century, connecting the towns along the Adriatic coast of Slovenia, Italy, and Croatia. Today, the Parenzana route has been transformed into a biking trail, providing a unique opportunity to explore the stunning scenery of the region.

Along the way, we stopped at several points of interest, including the Church of St. George in Piran.
