## Visiting the Zelenci Natural Reserve
We started our day by visiting the Zelenci Natural Reserve. The reserve is known for its beautiful and diverse landscape. The highlight of the reserve is the Zelenci Lake. Zelenci get their name from the color of the lake, zelen, which means green in Slovenian. The natural lake is fed by underground springs that boil trough a layer of lake chalk at the bottom, forming bubbles and leading to its distinct green color. at is home to a variety of aquatic plants and wildlife.  We took a leisurely walk around the lake, taking in the beautiful views of the surrounding mountains and the peaceful atmosphere of the reserve. The Zelenci natural reserve is a great place for nature lovers, bird watchers and hikers.

## Crossing the Vrsic Mountain Pass by car
After our time at Lake Jasna, we had to cross the Vrsic Mountain Pass with our car. The Vrsic Mountain Pass is the highest road pass in the Eastern Julian Alps (1611m) that connects the Kranjska Gora with Trenta, the upper part of the Soca valley. The winding road, which runs over Vrsic is 24 kilometres in length with an average ascent at 8.4% and it has 50 hairpin bends. It is known for its challenging roads and spectacular views. As we had rented a manual car, it was quite challenging for us to cross the pass, but the views of the surrounding mountains and valleys made it all worth it. We advise people wanting to cross the Vrsic Mountain Pass to be prepared for a challenging drive. Be aware of the road conditions. The road is narrow and winding, with tight turns and steep inclines. Be prepared for oncoming traffic, and make sure to give yourself plenty of space when passing other vehicles.

Take your time and drive carefully. If you take your time and drive cautiously, you'll be able to enjoy the spectacular views without putting yourself or others at risk. Keep a lookout for interesting places. The Vrsic pass is a beautiful and interesting road, there are many places where you can stop and take pictures or explore the area, such as the Russian chapel, which is a small Orthodox church built by Russian prisoners of war during World War I.

## Hiking to the source of the Soca River
After crossing the Vrsic Mountain Pass, we decided to stop and do a hike to the source of the Soca River. It was an adventurous hike that took us through the beautiful Soca Valley, with a via ferrata style section that added an extra level of excitement. The views from the via ferrata are truly breathtaking and it's an experience that we will always remember. The final destination of the hike is the source of the Soca River, a beautiful and serene place, surrounded by towering peaks and lush green forests. It's a peaceful and quiet place, the perfect spot to relax and take in the beauty of the surroundings. The source of the Soca River is a must-see destination for nature lovers and hikers, it's a great place to explore and to experience the beauty of the Slovenian Julian Alps.

## Rafting adventure on the Soca River
The morning of Day 6 was spent rafting along the Soca River, with the activity conveniently organized by Kamp Vodenca. We didn't have to worry about planning or logistics. The rafting trip was an exciting adventure, including a stop at a 7m high rock where the bravest could climb and jump for an adrenaline rush (yes we jumped and we fully recommend it!).
