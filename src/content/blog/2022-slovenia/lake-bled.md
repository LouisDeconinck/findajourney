Lake Bled, located in the Julian Alps in Slovenia, is a stunning natural wonder that attracts visitors from all over the world. With its crystal-clear waters, surrounded by majestic mountains and a medieval castle perched on a hilltop, Lake Bled offers a unique blend of natural beauty and cultural heritage.

## Strolling around Lake Bled

When we arrived at Lake Bled, we were so excited to see the lake that we decided to walk around it the same day. The lake is a stunning natural wonder, surrounded by the Julian Alps and it's a popular spot for swimming, boating, and hiking.

We strolled along the lake and stopped at Staza Bled, where we took a chairlift to a viewpoint and went down with a Tobogganing. The chair lift ride provided us with a birds-eye-view of the lake and the surrounding area. Tobogganing is a unique way to experience the lake and it was a lot of fun and we fully recommend it.

## Tasting traditional Slovenian desserts

We also stopped at Café Belvedere to try some typical Slovenian desserts, including the famous "bled cream cake" and "Prekmurska Gibanica". The "Bled cream cake" is a traditional cream cake from the Bled area that is made with layers of puff pastry and vanilla custard cream.

The "Prekmurska Gibanica" is a traditional pastry from the Prekmurje region, that is made with cottage cheese, poppy seeds, and apple filling. It was a great experience, as we had a great view of the lake from our table.

## A bird's-eye-view of Lake Bled and sunset at Mala Ojstrica viewpoint

Next, we went to the viewpoint Mala Ojstrica, where we were rewarded with one of the best views of the lake. The sun had already disappeared, but the view was still breathtaking.

From this viewpoint, you could see the lake, the island, the castle, and the surrounding mountains all in one glance. It was a perfect spot to take some beautiful photos and enjoy the peacefulness of the lake.

## A comfortable stay at Villa Mint & Lavender

After a long day of exploring, we decided to walk back to our airbnb, Villa Mint & Lavender. The owner of Villa Mint & Lavender is really nice and made a lot of recommendations of things to do near lake bled.

We were exhausted but satisfied after such a great day. Lake Bled is a must-see destination in Slovenia, and we were glad we had the chance to explore it and its surroundings. The combination of natural beauty and the cultural experiences we had that day, made it a day to remember.

## Exploring Lake Bohinj

After spending the night in the comfortable Villa Mint & Lavender, we enjoyed a delicious breakfast, made by the owner, with waffles before starting our journey to Lake Bohinj.

Lake Bohinj is a large glacial lake that is located in the Julian Alps and is known for its natural beauty and tranquility. It's also the largest permanent lake in Slovenia.

## Hiking in the Seven Lakes Valley

Our first stop was at Slap Savica, which is a waterfall of 78meters located near Lake Bohinj. The waterfall was beautiful, but it was a bit too touristy for our taste.

However, there are some nice hiking trails that start from there. We decided to take a hike up to Dom na Komni and Koča pod Bogatinom in the Seven Lakes Valley. The valley is known for its seven beautiful alpine lakes, that are situated in the heart of the Julian Alps.

The hike was challenging for us as we climbed 1500m height meters and we didn't have a lot of experience hiking. The trail was steep, rocky and it's not well marked. We passed beautiful alpine landscapes, dense forest, and as we climbed higher, we were rewarded with beautiful panoramic views of the valley and the surrounding mountain ranges.

The trail also offered us really nice views of Lake Bohinj from above. We had a well-desirved lunch in the mountain hut Koča pod Bogatinom.

## Swimming to the island of Lake Bled

After the hike, we drove back to Lake Bled, and decided to take on one last challenge: swimming to the island of Lake Bled and back. The island is located in the middle of the lake and it's home to the Church of the Assumption, a small church that is a popular destination for visitors.

Swimming to the island and back was a great way to end the day and we felt a sense of accomplishment. The water was crystal clear and it was a peaceful experience as the sun set. For those who don't want to swim, it's also possible to visit the island by taking a traditional wooden boat called a pletna boat, which is a popular option among travelers.

## Discovering Slap Pericnik waterfall

The next day, we woke up early to explore one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Slovenia, Slap Pericnik. The waterfall is located near the village of Mojstrana and is known for its unique feature of being able to walk behind the waterfall.

The trail to the waterfall is easy to follow and takes you through a beautiful forest. The trail itself is not too long, and it takes around 20 minutes to reach the waterfall. As we got closer to the waterfall, we could hear the sound of the water cascading down the rocks.

Once we reached the waterfall, we were amazed by its beauty. The waterfall falls down in two steps: the upper fall is 16 meters high and the lower fall 52 meters, this one is the most spectacular and you can admire it from different point of views.

It was a unique and special experience to be able to walk behind it, the water curtain of Slap Peričnik ceated the finishing touch on the tremendous views on the valley. The cool mist created by the waterfall was also a welcome relief on a hot summer day.

## The beauty of Vintgar Gorge

In the afternoon we visited Vintgar Gorge. This is a spectacular gorge that is located near the town of Bled. The gorge is carved by the Radovna River and is around 1.6 kilometers long. The trail takes you along the river, and you can see the beautiful waterfalls and rapids along the way.

The highlight of the trail is the 16-meter high Sum waterfall, which is a stunning sight. The trail itself is easy to walk and takes around 1.5 hours to complete.

The trail is well maintained and has wooden walkways and bridges that allow you to get a close-up view of the gorge. However, it can be quite touristic, especially during peak season, so it's best to go early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the crowds. Despite the crowds, we found the experience of walking through the gorge to be beautiful and we recommend visiting it.
