The attention to detail in this escape room is amazing. The Fintra bank looks so real that people passing by often think it's an actual bank! The game starts with a cool movie that sets the scene and gives you important clues. Entering the bank from the street, just like you would in real life, makes the experience even more realistic.

Here’s a funny fact: in the past, players had to wear masks during the game, but it was so realistic that people outside sometimes called the police, thinking a real bank robbery was happening! This shows just how convincing the experience is.

## Innovative Features

One unique feature is that you use personal bank cards to interact with an ATM, adding a fun, interactive touch. The puzzles are smartly designed, and the high-tech security systems make the game challenging and exciting. It's fast-paced and full of surprises. You’ll need to work closely with your team to beat the security systems and grab the money before time runs out. The rush of solving tough puzzles is unbeatable!

After you finish the game, whether you win or lose, you can sit down with a drink and talk about the experience. This debriefing time was a nice touch, letting us reflect on the game and laugh about our close calls.
