Kortrijk is known for its rich history, but did you know you can also explore this city from the water? We had the chance to take a boat trip with [De Keper](https://de-keper.be/), a local boat rental company that has been offering fantastic experiences for over seven years.

Our journey began at the iconic Broeltorens, a beautiful spot to start your trip.

De Keper started with just two boats named "Manten" and "Kalle", after the bell ringers of Kortrijk’s Belfry Tower.

Today, they offer six different boats, with sizes ranging from 6 to 12 people. Their most popular boat, "Julia", is perfect for families and can accommodate 8 passengers. This is also the one we boarded.

We set sail first towards Wevelgem, enjoying the green banks and calm waters. The weather was ideal—a sun-soaked day with a gentle breeze, perfect for a refreshing boat trip.

What made this experience even more special was that we were allowed to steer the boat ourselves. It gave us a sense of freedom that you rarely experience.

After a while, we turned back and headed towards Harelbeke. Along the way, we soaked in the stunning views and peaceful atmosphere. The boat we were on, "Julia", was equipped with a fridge, which was perfect for keeping our snacks and drinks cool—a must on a warm summer day!

The service from Karl, the owner, is exceptional. He grew up around boats, with his parents owning a pleasure yacht, and has a deep passion for sailing. De Keper serves a wide range of customers—from families and friends to companies, associations, and even nursing homes. Whether it's for a fun day out, a company event, or a bachelor party, De Keper has something for everyone.
