It was originally named Leiepark when it was established in 1905 on a filled-in bend of the Leie River. It was later renamed Koning Albertpark.

You can admire the 'Moeder Aarde' art piece and 'The Leie Monument'. The latter was officially inaugurated by the late King Baudouin in 1957. It is a site of annual commemorations in May by veterans and patriotic groups for soldiers who fell during WWII. It was restored in 2007.

The park is named after the Van Raemdonck brothers, Flemish soldiers who died during World War I. The park was created around 1959.

The park's centerpiece is a large pond with a small peninsula that serves as a home for many breeding birds. It has a wide range of trees: oaks, birches, pines, and more rare species like honey locust, European Judas tree, and Japanese larch.

The park was named after Queen Astrid, who visited Kortrijk on April 5, 1935, but the park is older than its name. City architect Victor Moulart designed the first part in 1906, and in 1931, a statue of Mayor August Reynaert was placed in the park's French garden.

Key features include a large pond, gently sloping grassy areas perfect for relaxation, and a gloriette (small pavilion), adding architectural interest.

The park's rich history dates back to the second half of the 19th century when the Vercruysse family built an empire-style country house with an adjoining English landscape garden.

In 1985, the country house was demolished without a permit. Recognizing the park's historical and cultural value, in 2003, the English landscape garden, including several typical garden elements such as the gloriette, was granted protected status.
